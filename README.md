# About

Small SBT plugin that will contain roughly the functionality of the maven-tag-list plugin when done.


The plugin contains the task "tag-list" which performs a case insensitive search in the sources 
of a project for a set of keywords. The default keywords are "todo" and "fixme"

# Installation

Add the following lines to ~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt or PROJECT_DIR/project/plugins.sbt:

    resolvers += "sbt-taglist-releases" at "http://johanandren.github.com/releases/"

    addSbtPlugin("com.markatta" % "taglist-plugin" % "1.1")


And then this line to PROJECT_DIR/build.sbt to include the task tag-list into your project:

    seq(TagListPlugin.tagListSettings: _*)


# Configuration
The plugin uses the regular source settings for your sbt-project so it should work out of the box with non-standard directory structures etc. 

If you want to change what keywords the plugin searches for you can do so by modifying tagWords like this in PROJECT_DIR/build.sbt:

    TagListPlugin.TagListKeys.tagWords := Set(Tag("TODO"), Tag("!", Level.Error))
